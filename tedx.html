                    <p>For 1 year, 7 months, and 28 days (and counting), R Matthews has been growing out his dreadlocks.
                        For him, it has served as his connection to his Jamaican heritage, but also his mom. But there
                        have been many people, including R's parents, who insisted that he cut his hair if he ever
                        wanted a meaningful job in corporate America. So throughout his dreadlock journey, he has been
                        forced to face the question at hand: “my hair or a job?” Why is he forced to choose? His talk,
                        Loc'd and Coded: The Politics of Dreadlocks, focuses on thinking critically about the perception
                        of dreadlocks and respectability politics.

                        This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
                        by a local community. Learn more <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx">here</a>.</p>
